httpget
=======

httpget is a simple HTTP file retriever. It uses version 1.1 of the HTTP
protocol, but should deal with responses generated by servers using
earlier versions as well.

Supported HTTP features:

* Chunked responses
* Byte serving (continuing interrupted transfer)
* Request redirection
* Basic authentication

httpget was written solely for educational purposes and is distributed without
any warranty.

Installation
------------

```
$ make
# make install
```

Usage
-----

```
$ httpget [option]... URL
```

This command downloads a file located at `URL`. Unless `-o` option is
used, the last component of `URL` will be used for the local file name,
or `index.html` if `URL` ends with a slash.

To get the list of all available options, type

```
$ httpget -h
```

Examples
--------

* Write the content of a HTTP file to `stdout`

```
$ httpget -o - example.com
```

* Save the content of a HTTP file to `example.html`

```
$ httpget -o example.html example.com
```

*  Resume an interrupted transfer

```
$ httpget -o example.html -c - example.com
```

* Disable redirections

```
$ httpget -r 0 example.com
```

* Pass credentials and allow to forward them when redirecting to another
  host

```
$ httpget -u user:passwd -L example.com
```

* Enable debug output (prints sent and received HTTP headers to
  `stderr`):

```
$ httpget -v example.com
```
